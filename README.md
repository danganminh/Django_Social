# Building a Social Website

## WeSite name: MySocial

We are going to create a social application that will allow users to share images they
find on the Internet. We will need to build the following elements for this project:

- An authentication system for users to register, log in, edit their profile,
and change or reset their password
- A followers' system to allow users to follow each other
- An activity stream for each user that allows users to see the content
uploaded by the people they follow
